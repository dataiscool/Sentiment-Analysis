# Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB movie ratings dataset
In this project, I implement naive Bayes and logistic regression to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie ratings dataset. The model classifies a review as either positive or negative for a specific movie.

The naive Bayes model was implemented from scratch, while the logistic regression was implemented using SciKit learn.
